In this project, I'm going to focus on electricity generation by renewable energy sources for each country. The actual list of countries I'm using was pulled off of GitHub at the following link: https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699

Here are some questions I would like to answer (project aims):

1) How has electricity generation by renewables changed over time? 

It's increasing exponentially! Which I suppose was obvious, but still encouraging. 

2) Which countries are contributing most (top 10 countries to keep it simple) to changes in electricity generation by renewables?

From Greatest to least: U.S., Germany, China, Japan, Spain, Italy, Brazil, India, UK, Canada.

3) Within the top 10, what renewable is providing the majority of electricity generation? 

Check Project Aim 3 notebook for info.


The dataset containing data on electricity generated by renewables in kWh by country was pulled from The World Bank website.
